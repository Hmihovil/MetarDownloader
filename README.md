# MetarDownloader

This app downloads the latest METAR from www.aviationweather.gov.
METAR is the encoded weather status of nearly 5000 airports around the world.

You can choose which airport's METAR you want to view by typing the 4-letter
ICAO identifier, eg.:
EPWA - Warsaw Chopin Airport
KDFW - Dallas/Fort Worth
KJFK - New York JFK

After the METAR is displayed, you can press in the radio button to show its decoded 
version.

Enjoy.
